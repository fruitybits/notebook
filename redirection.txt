Redirection helps you move the output from one command and put the contents into another file in your system. 

	1/ History will give you a history of your command lines
	2/ cmd - control - l will clear the screen but let you scroll to previous content
	3/ cmd k  will clear the screen but not let you scroll to previous content
	4/ to run a specific command from history, use the ! And the number of the command. !555.
	5/ to run the last command from history, you can use bang bang or !!
	6/ The “>” symbol outputs a commands contents into a new file. So you could do history > notes.txt to create a text file of your history. It overwrites what’s currently in the file.
	7/ Double “> >” to be able to append. Note that in the history log this will cause history to skip some numbers.
	8/ head displays the first 10 lines of a file. You could also return more lines by doing head -n X, where X is the number of lines you’d like to show
	9/ tail provides the last 10 lines of a file. You can also return more lines by doing tail -n X, where X is the number of lines you’d like to show.	
	10/ find will return path of the file you’re looking for. For example find ~/Projects -name notes.txt.
